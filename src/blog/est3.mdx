## Simple linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression Simple linear regression provides a model of the relationship between the magnitude of one variable and that of a second for example, as X increases, Y also increases. Or as X increases, Y decreases.1 Correlation is another way to measure how two variables are related see. Stimates how much Y will change when X changes by a certain amount. With the correlation coefficient, the variables X and Y are interchangeable, With regression, we are trying to predict the Y variable from X using a linear relationship

$$Y_{i}=b_{0}+b_{1}X_{i}+e_{i}$$
$$Y_{i}=b_{0}+b_{1}X_{i}+e_{i}$$

- __Response__ The variable we are trying to predict.
 _Synonyms dependent variable, Y variable, target, outcome_

- __Independent variable__ The variable used to predict the response.
_Synonyms X variable, feature, attribute, predictor_

- __Record__ The vector of predictor and outcome values for a specific individual or case.
_Synonyms row, case, instance, example_

- __Intercept__ The intercept of the regression line—that is, the predicted value when X = 0. 
_Synonyms b0, β0_

- __Regression coefficient__ The slope of the regression line. 
_Synonyms slope, b1, β1, parameter estimates, weights_

- __Fitted values__ The estimates Yi obtained from the regression line. 
_Synonym predicted values_

- __Residuals__ The difference between the observed values and the fitted values.
_Synonym errors_

- __Least squares__ The method of fitting a regression by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
_Synonym Ordinary least squares, OLS_

## Multiple linear Regression
- __Least squares__ The method of fitting a regression by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
 - __Root mean squared error__
The square root of the average squared error of the regression (this is the most widely used metric to compare regression models).
 Synonym RMSE

 - __Residual standard error__
 The same as the root mean squared error, but adjusted for degrees of freedom. Synonym RSE

 - __R-squared__
 The proportion of variance explained by the model, from 0 to 1. 
Synonyms coefficient of determination, R2

 - __t-statistic__
 The coefficient for a predictor, divided by the standard error of the coefficient, giving a metric to compare the importance of variables in the model. See “t-Tests” on page 110.

 - __Weighted regression__
 Regression with the records having different weights.


The primary purpose of regression in data science is prediction. This is useful to keep in mind, since regression, being an old and established statistical method, comes with baggage that is more relevant to its traditional role as a tool for explanatory modeling
 -__Dummy variables__
Binary 0–1 variables derived by recoding factor data for use in regression and other models. 
 -__Reference coding__
 The most common type of coding used by statisticians, in which one level of a factor is used as a reference and other factors are compared to that level. Synonym treatment coding 
 -__One hot encoder__
 A common type of coding used in the machine learning community in which all factor levels are retained. While useful for certain machine learning algorithms, this approach is not appropriate for multiple linear regression. 
-__Deviation coding __
A type of coding that compares each level against the overall mean as opposed to the reference level. Synonym sum contrasts Dummy Variables Representation
