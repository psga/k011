## Simple linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression Simple linear regression provides a model of the relationship between the magnitude of one variable and that of a second for example, as X increases, Y also increases. Or as X increases, Y decreases.1 Correlation is another way to measure how two variables are related see. Stimates how much Y will change when X changes by a certain amount. With the correlation coefficient, the variables X and Y are interchangeable, With regression, we are trying to predict the Y variable from X using a linear relationship

$$Y=b_{0}+b_{1}X$$

- __Response__ The variable we are trying to predict.
 _Synonyms dependent variable, Y variable, target, outcome_

- __Independent variable__ The variable used to predict the response.
_Synonyms X variable, feature, attribute, predictor_

- __Record__ The vector of predictor and outcome values for a specific individual or case.
_Synonyms row, case, instance, example_

- __Intercept__ The intercept of the regression line—that is, the predicted value when X = 0. 
_Synonyms b0, β0_

- __Regression coefficient__ The slope of the regression line. 
_Synonyms slope, b1, β1, parameter estimates, weights_

- __Fitted values__ The estimates Yi obtained from the regression line. 
_Synonym predicted values_

- __Residuals__ The difference between the observed values and the fitted values.
_Synonym errors_

- __Least squares__ The method of fitting a regression by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
_Synonym Ordinary least squares, OLS_
