# Array
An array is a way to store data of the same type or class (integers, characters, Boolean, etc.), although in some languages data of different classes can be stored.
each element is enumerated with its index. With this you can easily access an array element only with its index.
the enumeration of these elements within the array starts from 0 in most languages and this implies that it ends at n-1 (where n is the size of the array, the number of elements). For this reason it is said that in programming we start counting from 0.
The array is probably the simplest and most widely used data structure.

In python you can declare
```python 
array=["1","2","3"]
# ind:  0   1   2
```
you can access an object with its index, for example

```python 
array[1]
#output: 2
```
There are several methods that can be used in an array. here are some of them

### append
```python 
array.append("4") #O(1)
```
This method will add an element to the end of the list. this will not change the indixes of the other elements.so it will have a complexity of 1 because 

### pop

```python 
array.pop() #O(1)
```
This method will remove the last item from the list, and like the previous method, this will not change the indexes of the other items, so it will have a complexity of 1 since it will have a complexity of 1.
so it will have a complexity of 1 because 
Although pop will also delete an element if we give it the index as parameter 

```python 
array.pop(2) #O(n)
```
But it will no longer have a complexity of 1. It will be n
### insert
```python 
array.insert(0,"0")#O(1)
```
This method will insert the "0" at the top of the list but will move all other items to the right 1 index. This will make the complexity n (the size of the list)

there are many more methods that we can find like max, min, sort that can be seen in the <a href='https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity'>python wiki</a>
