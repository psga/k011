# Cryptography
Cryptography is the set of techniques which are used to hide information. That is to say, to make messages intelligible to unauthorized receivers.
## Simetry Cryptography 
Symmetric cryptography is a method of cryptography in which a key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
This means that the sender and the receiver must have the key and if for some reason a third person obtains the key, they will be able to decrypt the message.

## Asimetry Cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography is also a cryptographic method which solves the third person error in symmetric cryptography, because unlike symmetric cryptography, it uses 2 keys:
A public key and a private key.
An example to understand this well is to think of a mailbox (being the mailbox the public key), anyone can send a letter inside the mailbox but no one can see what is inside the mailbox, unless he has the key (private key).
This is how wallets work

## Hash functions
The hash function is a computable function which causes a data, mostly used in strings, to be converted into an infinite range of outputs, usually fixed-length strings.
These functions can be used in cryptocurrency mining (hash rate) or in private data (such as when a company stores passwords or data).
