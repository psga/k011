## A/B testing
The term A/B is used to describe randomized experiments with two variants , A and B, one being the control and the other the variant. Another way to generally refer to A/B tests is with the term split test, although the latter method is applied when experiments with more than two variants are performed.
- __Treatment__		Sometrhing to which a subject is exposed.
- __Treatment group__ 	A group of subjects exposed to a specific treatment.
- __Control group__ 	A group of subjects exposed to no treatment.
- __Randomization__	The process of randomly assigning subjects to treatments.
- __Subjects__ 		The items that are exposed to treatments 
- __Test statistic__ 	The metric used to measure the effect of the treatment. 

Subjects are assigned to two (or more) groups that are treated exactly alike, except that the treatment under study differs from one group to another.

Ideally, subjects are assigned randomly to the groups

## Hypothesis Tests
are ubiquitous in the traditional statistical analysis of published research. Their purpose is to help you learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect

- __Null Hypothesis__		The hypothesis that chance is to blame.
- __Alternative hypothesis__ 	Counterpoint to the null.
- __One-way test__ 		Hypothesis test that counts chance results only in one direction.
- __Two-way test__		Hypothesis test that counts chance results in two directions.
The hypothesis test assumes that the null hypothesis is true, creates a "null model", and tests whether the effect you observe is a reasonable outcome of that model

### The null hypothesis

A null hypothesis is an assumption used to deny or affirm an event in relation to some parameter or parameters of a population or sample.

A null hypothesis is a logical construct embodying the notion that nothing special has happened, and any effect you observe is due to random chance

### Alternative Hypothesis

Hypothesis tests by their nature involve not just a null hypothesis but also an offseting alternative hypothesis.

- Null="No difference between the means of group A and group B"; alternative = "A is different from B".
- Null="A<=A"; alternative ="A>B".

_Taken togheter, the null and alternative hypotheses must account for all possibilities_
