## A/B testing
The term A/B is used to describe randomized experiments with two variants , A and B, one being the control and the other the variant. Another way to generally refer to A/B tests is with the term split test, although the latter method is applied when experiments with more than two variants are performed.
- __Treatment__		Sometrhing to which a subject is exposed.
- __Treatment group__ 	A group of subjects exposed to a specific treatment.
- __Control group__ 	A group of subjects exposed to no treatment.
- __Randomization__	The process of randomly assigning subjects to treatments.
- __Subjects__ 		The items that are exposed to treatments 
- __Test statistic__ 	The metric used to measure the effect of the treatment. 

Subjects are assigned to two (or more) groups that are treated exactly alike, except that the treatment under study differs from one group to another.

Ideally, subjects are assigned randomly to the groups

## Hypothesis Tests
are ubiquitous in the traditional statistical analysis of published research. Their purpose is to help you learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect

- __Null Hypothesis__		The hypothesis that chance is to blame.
- __Alternative hypothesis__ 	Counterpoint to the null.
- __One-way test__ 		Hypothesis test that counts chance results only in one direction.
- __Two-way test__		Hypothesis test that counts chance results in two directions.
The hypothesis test assumes that the null hypothesis is true, creates a "null model", and tests whether the effect you observe is a reasonable outcome of that model

### The null hypothesis

A null hypothesis is an assumption used to deny or affirm an event in relation to some parameter or parameters of a population or sample.

A null hypothesis is a logical construct embodying the notion that nothing special has happened, and any effect you observe is due to random chance

### Alternative Hypothesis

Hypothesis tests by their nature involve not just a null hypothesis but also an offseting alternative hypothesis.

- Null="No difference between the means of group A and group B"; alternative = "A is different from B".
- Null="A<=A"; alternative ="A>B".

_Taken togheter, the null and alternative hypotheses must account for all possibilities_

### Resampling
Resampling means to repeatedly sample values from observed data, with a general goal of assessing random variability in a statistic. It can also be used to asess and improve the accuracy of some machine-learning models

Drawind  additional samples from an observed data set

there are two main types of resampling procedures: bootstrap and permutation tests.

__ Permutation test __: also called randomization test,random permutation test, exact test
The procedure of combining two or more samples together and randomly reallocating the observation to resamples..
- combine the results from the different groups into a single data set.
- Shuffle the combined data and then dandomly draw a resample of the same size as group A
- From the remaining data, randomly draw a resample of the same size as group B

__Exhaustive and Bootstrap Permutation Test __:
In addition to the preceding random shuffling procedure, also called a random per‐ mutation test or a randomization test, there are two variants of the permutation test:
- Exhaustive permutation test: just randomly shuffling and dividing the data, we actually figure out all the possible ways it could be divided. This is practical only for relatively small sample sizes. This is also called _Exact test_
- A bootstrap permutation test: In this way the resampling procedure models not just the random element in the assigment of treatment to subject but also the random element in the section of subjects from a population. 
__Permutation tests__:
Permutation tests are useful heuristic procedures for exploring the role of random variation. They are relatively easy to code, interpret, and explain, and they offer a use‐ ful detour around the formalism and “false determinism” of formula-based statistics, in which the precision of formula “answers” tends to imply unwarranted certainty.
In a permutation test, are multiple samples are combined and then shuffled.
The shuffled values are then divided into resamples, and the statistics of interest is calculated

### Statistical Significance and p-Values
Statistical significance is how statisticians measure whether an experiment (or even a study of existing data) yields a result more extreme than what chance might produce. If the result is beyond the realm of chance variation, it is said to be statistically signicant
- __ p-value __; given a chance model that embodies the null hypothesis, the p-value is the probability of obtaining results as unusual or extreme as the observed results
- __ Alpha __ The probability threshold of "unusualness" that chance results must surpass for actual outcomes to be deemed statistically significant
- __ Type 1 error__ Mistakenly concluding an effect is real (when it is due to chance)
- __ Type 2 error__ Mistakenly concluding an effect is due to chance (when it is real)
- __ __
