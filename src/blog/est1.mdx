# Normal Distribution
-__<a href="https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/blobel/blobel_errors.pdf" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">Error</a>__ The difference between a data point and a predicted or average value

-__<a href="https://neo4j.com/" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">QQ plot</a>__ A plot to visualize how close a sample distribution is to a specified distribution, e.g., the normal distribution.


A standard normal distribution is one in which the units on the x-axis are expressed in terms of standard devitions away from the mean. To compare data to a standard normal distribution, you subtract the mean and then divide by the standar deviation(_normalization_ or _standardization_)


A QQ-Plot is used to visually determine how close a sample is to a specified distribution-In this case, the normal distribution
```cpp
fig,ax =plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))
norm_sample=stats.norm.rvs(size=100)
stats.probplot(norm_sample,plot=ax)
```
with the method scipy.stats.probplot

# Long-Tailed Distributions
The long tail is the colloquial name for a well-known feature of statistical distributions (Zipf, power-law, Pareto distributions and in general LÃ©vy distributions). The feature is also known as heavy tails, power-law tails, or Pareto tails. These distributions are similar to the graph that accompanies these lines.
In these distributions a large frequenct or high frecuency of "transactions" is followed by a low frequency or low amplitude of the gradually decreasing population. In many cases, the low frequency or low amplitude events-the long tail, represented here by the yellow portion of the graph-may comprise most of the graph

While the normal distribution is often appropiate and useful with respect to the distribution of errors and sample statistics, it typically does not characterize the distribution of raw data; or the distribution can be discrete, as with binomial data.
```cpp
nflx = sp500px.NFLX
nflx = np.diff(np.log(nflx[nflx>0]))
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))
stats.probplot(nflx,plot=ax)
```

# Student's t-Distribution

In probability and statistics, Student's  t-distribution is a probability distribution that arises from the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.

It appears naturally when performing Student's t-test for the determination of the differences between the parts of two populations when the standard deviation of a population is unknown and must be estimated from sample data.

# Binomial Distribution
- __Trial__ An event with a discrete outcome.
- __Succes (i)__ The outcome of interest for a trial.
- __Binomial__ Having two outcomes.
- __Binomial trial (Bernoulli trial)__ A trial with two outcomes
- __Binomial Distribution (Bernoulli Distribution)__ Distribution of number of successes in x trials 

Fundamental to understanding the binomial distribution is the idea of a set of trials, each of which has two possible outcomes with defined probabilities.For example, flippping a coin 10 times is a binomial experiment with 10 trials, each trial having two possible outcomes(heads or tails);Such yes/no or 0/1 outcomes are termed binary outcomes, and they need not have 50/50 probabilities. 
The binomial distribution is the frequency distribution of the number of successes (x) in a given number of trials(n) with specified probability (p) of success in each trial. There is a family of binomial distribution, depending on the values of n and p. The binomial distribution would answer question like:

Binomial outcomes are important to model,since they represent, among other things, fundamental decisions(buy or don't buy, click or don't click, survive or die, etc.).
with a large n, and provided p is not too close to 0 or 1, the binomial distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution.

The __scipy.stats__ module implements a large variety of statistical distributions. For the binomial distribution, use the functions stats.binom.pmf and stats.binom.cdf
```cpp
stats.binom.pmf(2, n=5, p=0.1)

stats.binom.cdf(2, n=5, p=0.1)
```
# Chi-Square Distribution
The chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in Statistical Inference, mainly in hypothesis testing and in the construction of confidence intervals.
The chi-square distribution is the distribution of this statistic under repeated resampled draws from the null model

- The chi-suqare distribution is typically concerned with counts of subjects or items falling into categories.
- The chi-square statistic measures the extent of departure from what you would expect in a null model

# F-Distribution
The F-distribution is used with experiments and linear models involving measured data. And the F-Statistic compares variation due to factors of interest to overall variation.
