# Normal Distribution
-__<a href="https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/blobel/blobel_errors.pdf" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">Error</a>__ The difference between a data point and a predicted or average value

-__<a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/standardization/" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">Standardize</a>__ Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation   	

-__<a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">z-score</a>__ the result of standardizing an individual data point

-__<a href="https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_probability/bs704_probability9.html" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">standard normal</a>__ A normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

-__<a href="https://neo4j.com/" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">QQ plot</a>__ A plot to visualize how close a sample distribution is to a specified distribution, e.g., the normal distribution.


A standard normal distribution is one in which the units on the x-axis are expressed in terms of standard devitions away from the mean. To compare data to a standard normal distribution, you subtract the mean and then divide by the standar deviation(_normalization_ or _standardization_)


A QQ-Plot is used to visually determine how close a sample is to a specified distribution-In this case, the normal distribution
```cpp
fig,ax =plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))
norm_sample=stats.norm.rvs(size=100)
stats.probplot(norm_sample,plot=ax)
```
with the method scipy.stats.probplot

# Long-Tailed Distributions
The long tail is the colloquial name for a well-known feature of statistical distributions (Zipf, power-law, Pareto distributions and in general LÃ©vy distributions). The feature is also known as heavy tails, power-law tails, or Pareto tails. These distributions are similar to the graph that accompanies these lines.
In these distributions a large frequenct or high frecuency of "transactions" is followed by a low frequency or low amplitude of the gradually decreasing population. In many cases, the low frequency or low amplitude events-the long tail, represented here by the yellow portion of the graph-may comprise most of the graph

While the normal distribution is often appropiate and useful with respect to the distribution of errors and sample statistics, it typically does not characterize the distribution of raw data; or the distribution can be discrete, as with binomial data.
```cpp
nflx = sp500px.NFLX
nflx = np.diff(np.log(nflx[nflx>0]))
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))
stats.probplot(nflx,plot=ax)
```

# Student's t-Distribution

In probability and statistics, Student's  t-distribution is a probability distribution that arises from the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.

It appears naturally when performing Student's t-test for the determination of the differences between the parts of two populations when the standard deviation of a population is unknown and must be estimated from sample data.

differences in averages

- __<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" class="link  white hover-white-60" target="_blank">Degrees of freedom</a>__ A parameter that allows the t-distribution to adjust to different sample sizes, statistics, and number of groups

# Binomial Distribution
- __Trial__ An event with a discrete outcome.
- __Succes (i)__ The outcome of interest for a trial.
- __Binomial__ Having two outcomes.
- __Binomial trial (Bernoulli trial)__ A trial with two outcomes
- __Binomial Distribution (Bernoulli Distribution)__ Distribution of number of successes in x trials
