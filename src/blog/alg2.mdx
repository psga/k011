# Sorting algorithms
Sorting algorithms are the methods of reorganize a large numbers of items into some order, the relation of order most common items are the numbers order or lexicgraphic order

## What is it used for?

The sorting algothims can be seen in companies like Google, Amazon, Apple. are highly used in data. Some examples can we see is:

- Order a list of products or clients by name
- Order a list of products by prices
- Order a list by size

the most of the programming lenguages have a function prederterminate to sorting elements, but has a problem:

**the issue with sort():** By not knowing wich algorithm we are using, we can have a problems. like in js the sort() method order elements by their unicode value, this implies that (3,1,22,100)â€”>(1,100,22,3).

## Algoritms:

Exist a large sorting algorithms, that we can see them in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). all of these have their advantages and disavantages.

# Comparison sort

## Burble sort

the burble sort algortithm no have any situation practical. no situation in whitch we should use it.

Is very easy to implemet

```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j + 1] :
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```

## Selection sort

This one has no practical use, as above

likewise, this is very easy to implement 

```python
def selection_sort(L):
    for i in range(len(L)-1):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(L)-1):
            if L[j] < L[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        L[i], L[min_index] = L[min_index], L[i]
```

## Insertion sort

```python
def insertionSort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] :
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```

This and the following 3 algorithms are part of the divide-and-conquer algorithms

## Merge Sort

```python
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr)//2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]
        mergeSort(L)
        mergeSort(R)
        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
 
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

## Quick Sort

```python
def partition(arr, low, high):
    i = (low-1)
    pivot = arr[high]
  
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            i = i+1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
  
    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
    return (i+1)
def quickSort(arr, low, high):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return arr
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1)
        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high)
```

## Heap sort

![ezgif-6-1cc95b60039a.gif](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ca923f8e-94cc-4b43-8f6d-b52766ffccdc/ezgif-6-1cc95b60039a.gif)

Heapsort is a non-recursive, non-stable, non-recursive sorting algorithm with computational complexity O(logn).

```python
def heapify(arr, n, i): #
    largest = i 
    l = 2 * i + 1
    r = 2 * i + 2
    if l < n and arr[i] < arr[l]:
        largest = l
    if r < n and arr[largest] < arr[r]:
        largest = r
    if largest != i:
        arr[i],arr[largest] = arr[largest],arr[i] 
        heapify(arr, n, largest)
def heapSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] 
        heapify(arr, i, 0)
```
