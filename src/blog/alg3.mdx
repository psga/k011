# Linear Search
linear search or sequence search is a method of finding a target value within the list.
It consist of going through and examing each of the elements of the array until we find the element(s) we are looking for, or until we have looked at all the elements of the array.

This is the slowest search method, but if our information is completely disordered, it is the only one that can help us find the data we are looking for.

# Binary Search
Binary search works on ordered arrays. It consists of eliminating half of the elements of the array on which the search is performed after each comparison, it starts comparing the elements in te middle of the array with the searched value. If the searched value is equal to the middle element, its position in the array is returned. if the searched value is less or greater than the middle element, the search will cotinue in the first or second half, respectively, leaving the other half out of consideration; and if they are equal, the searched value has been found and the position is returned
would function as a binary tree
