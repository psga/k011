# Linear Search
linear search or sequence search is a method of finding a target value within the list.
It consist of going through and examing each of the elements of the array until we find the element(s) we are looking for, or until we have looked at all the elements of the array.

This is the slowest search method, but if our information is completely disordered, it is the only one that can help us find the data we are looking for.

# Binary Search
Binary search works on ordered arrays. It consists of eliminating half of the elements of the array on which the search is performed after each comparison, it starts comparing the elements in te middle of the array with the searched value. If the searched value is equal to the middle element, its position in the array is returned. if the searched value is less or greater than the middle element, the search will cotinue in the first or second half, respectively, leaving the other half out of consideration; and if they are equal, the searched value has been found and the position is returned
would function as a binary tree

## Graph / Tree  traversal 
In an unordered tree or in a network how can we search for items?. For this there are 2 algorithms:

### Breadth First Search

Is another technique for traversing a graph. BFS visits the sibling vertices before visiting the child vertices, and a queue is used in the search process. this algorithm is ofted used to find the shortest path from one vertex to another.

#### PROS AND CONS

This algorithm is used when the location of the node is believed to be at a high level, it is  located above.

- **Pros**: Shortest Path, Closer Nodes
- **Cons**: More memory


### Depth First Search

this algorithm visits the child vertices before visiting the sibling vertices.
The algorithm begins with a chosen "root" vertex; it then iteratively transitions from the current vertex to an adjacent, unvisited vertex, until it can no longer find an unexplored vertex to transition to from this current location
#### PROS AND CONS

This algorithm is used when the location of the node is believed to be at a low level, it is  located above.

- **Pros**: Less Memory, Does path Exist?
- **Cons**: Can get slow
